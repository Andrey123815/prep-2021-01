Subject: Re: a MIME-Version misfeature

This message has been composed in the 'multipart' format for extended
mail bodies.  If you are reading this prefix, your mail reader probably has
not yet been modified to understand the new format, and some of what follows
may look strange.  You may wish to look into upgrading your mail reader.

However, the first part of this message (immediately after the funny-looking
boundary line) is the text-only version of the message.  If you read that part
and skip the rest, you will probably understand the gist of the message.

I have no problem with changing the BNF to permit the period, as Mark
suggests.   However, I disagree violently with the following comment:

Some kind of version number is, in my opinion, totally vital -- getting
rid of MIME-Version without some similar versioning mechanism to replace
it would be, for me, a real show-stopper.

By the way, this message is being sent by an experimental version of
Andrew I'm playing with.  I'd be interested in any comments you have on
its formatting, etc.  -- Nathaniel
